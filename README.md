### Monitor (deprecated)
`Monitor` is no longer developing because it is not designed to be out of the box📦.
`Monitor` is used to monitor PBS(qstat) server tasks. It's written in python🐍.
Please use this script at your own discretion.
This script is NOT designed to use on a public server, especially for a public account.
because passwords are stored in plain text, or there are modules missing.
It is however, designed to run on your own linux server, or windows subsystems (WSLs).
You should edit the config part below and install missing modules before use.
